=head1 DESCRIPTION

 This is the Policyd Weight configurator package for i-MSCP

 Perl policy daemon for the Postfix MTA Its intended to eliminate forged envelope senders and HELOs
(i.e. in bogus mails). It allows you to score DNSBLs (RBL/RHSBL), HELO, MAIL FROM and client IP addresses
before any queuing is done. It allows you to REJECT messages which have a score higher than allowed, providing
improved blocking of spam and virus mails. policyd-weight caches the most frequent client/sender combinations
(SPAM as well as HAM) to reduce the number of DNS queries.
